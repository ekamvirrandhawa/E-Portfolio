    "text": "My Background\nAs a student of the BBA International Double-Degree program across Brock University and Dublin City University, I will also be awarded a BA in Global Business (Data Analytics) in 2025.\n\n\nThis experience across both Canada has enabled me to expand my business expertise through two of the world’s major business cities, Toronto and Dublin. My most recent experience as part of my INTRA term at DCU was at Indeed, where I was a Tax Intern on a premier global tax team based in Dublin. Over the course of it I led statutory financial-statement checks for all non-US entities to ensure compliance, spearheaded an automation project that slashed fee-processing times, and partnered with leadership to gather insights for advanced pricing agreements.\nI’ve also honed my analytical skills coordinating real‑estate pro formas at Rice Group and mitigating risk on $10M+ daily invoice-factoring loans at BVD Capital. Proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, and advanced Excel, I’m passionate about using data-driven automation to streamline complex financial processes and inform strategic decision-making.\nHere are some of the institutions and organizations that have shaped my journey:"

    "text": "Shocks and Buffers: Evaluating the Bank of Canada’s COVID-19 Monetary Policy on Household Inflation, Liquidity, and Real Disposable Income\nEkamvir Randhawa, Global Business Thesis, Dublin City University, 2025\nDownload full thesis (PDF)\n\n\n\nThis dissertation investigates how the Bank of Canada’s rapid shift from near-zero rates and quantitative easing to an aggressive tightening cycle between 2020 Q1 and 2024 Q4 affected Canadian households. By combining surprise-shock regressions, event-study techniques, and a G7 benchmarking exercise, it traces policy impacts on headline inflation, real disposable income, savings buffers, credit growth, and mortgage arrears.\nKey Findings:\n\nLiquidity as the primary transmission channel: A 100 bp rate hike reduces the household saving rate by ~5 basis points and immediately contracts new consumer credit by 40 percent, while real income remains unchanged on impact.\n\nDefensive repayment behavior: Contrary to expectations, mortgage arrears decline during tightening, reflecting strategic pre-payment decisions reinforced by Canada’s stress-test regime.\n\nModest inflationary effects of QE: Each CAD 10 billion bond-buying injection raises inflation by ~0.02 pp but does not boost real income.\n\nInternational context: Canada’s real-income losses lie between those of the UK/US and France—evidence that targeted fiscal rebates and energy-price caps can cushion households more effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-pandemic pricing pressures: Do Canadians still face elevated inflation after the BoC’s historic policy pivot?\n\nRe-anchoring inflation: Did rate hikes and balance-sheet adjustments successfully return inflation to target?\n\nRestoration of spending power: Has stabilization of prices translated into a recovery of real disposable income?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData: Quarterly series (2020 Q1–2024 Q4) on CPI, real/nominal disposable income, savings rates, credit growth, and mortgage arrears.\n\nIdentification of shocks:\n\nRate Shock: overnight policy-rate changes\n\nQE Shock: quarter-on-quarter shifts in BoC bond holdings\n\n\nEmpirical blocks:\n\nSurprise-shock OLS regressions with Newey–West errors to estimate immediate elasticities.\n\nEvent-study framework to chart dynamics of savings, credit, and arrears around “high-shock” quarters.\n\nG7 benchmarking of real disposable income and inflation against the US, UK, Germany, and France.\n\nRobustness checks, including alternative trend specifications and placebo windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSavings depletion is the first casualty of tightening: households draw down buffers rather than cut income or default.\n\nMortgage arrears fall during tightening—evidence of proactive debt management, not distress.\n\nNon-mortgage credit contracts sharply in shock quarters but rebounds swiftly, implying temporary lender caution.\n\nQE’s role is primarily to sustain price levels, with negligible real-income or borrowing stimuli once GDP trends are controlled.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy coordination: Align tightening with measured fiscal rebates to preserve household liquidity without compromising inflation goals.\n\nRegulatory oversight: Monitor mortgage buffers and stress-test impacts as fixed-rate terms expire.\n\nQE exit strategy: A gradual, data-driven unwind mitigates market disruption while guarding against renewed inflation.\n\nStructural reforms: Address supply-side bottlenecks (e.g., housing, logistics) to complement monetary tools.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis thesis project across my final year was a project that allowed me to delve in my interest in Macroeconomics and expand on my studies in a self guided way while still remaining in the Data Analytics specialism at DCU, this helped me alot as this was alot of data analysis, hence my skills and knowledge from the data analytics specialsm had aided me alot from breaking down data to creating visualizations. It is a project that has allowed me to expand my knowledge about Canadian Banking and economics and find answers to questions that have roamed my mind since the pandemic. Finally, it was a great experience to experience alot of what higher education is founded upon; Research! It has given me further perspective overall of what it is that professors and much instituitions around that world partake in and expend many resources to do so, which has given me a greater appreciation for instituitions and those that are the heart of them all as they are the ones pushing the boundaries of the world and answering the big questions with integrity and precision."

Also, the company had allowed for much collaboration and fun outside of the office, I had the opportunities to further network but beyond that develop great friendships with colleague through many happy-hours, team building activites, and outings.\nDriving Impact with Automation\nWitnessing the “before and after” transformation when our automation tool went live, I witnessed immediately how much of a game changer it was for the team. I don’t think this would have been achievable anywhere else, as Indeed’s enviornment as a whole enabled me to look at things from my perspective and invited me to give my feedback overall where I thought things could be improved, bundled with one very supportive manager and team I flurished both in my skills but also with my personality.\nNavigating Global Tax Nuances\nExploring diverse regulatory environments across EMEA, APAC, and LATAM broadened my understanding of how local rules shape multinational tax strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Data-Handling Techniques\nEnhanced my proficiency in Excel (macros, Power Query) and began scripting lightweight Python routines to validate and reconcile large datasets.\nTransfer-Pricing Fundamentals\nHaving never heard of Transfer Pricing, going into this internship there were alot of ambiguous questions clouding my head.

However, even more than all of the great knowledge, and amazing skills, I felt that I grew very much as a person, I before was quite introverted and not too confident in my abilities coming into the internship. Since now, I can say I have developed into a refined young professional with a wealth of knowledge and understanding of the corportate world and the tax realms, and for this I would thank my manager Rory, and the amazing people throughout the company that I met that helped shape the growth I achieved in such a small amount of time."
